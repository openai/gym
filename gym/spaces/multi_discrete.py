    - The multi-discrete action space consists of a series of discrete action spaces with different number of actions in eachs
    - It is useful to represent game controllers or keyboards where each key can be represented as a discrete action space
    - It is parametrized by passing an array of positive integers specifying number of actions for each discrete action space

    Note: A value of 0 always need to represent the NOOP action.

    e.g. Nintendo Game Controller
    - Can be conceptualized as 3 discrete action spaces:

        1) Arrow Keys: Discrete 5  - NOOP[0], UP[1], RIGHT[2], DOWN[3], LEFT[4]  - params: min: 0, max: 4
        2) Button A:   Discrete 2  - NOOP[0], Pressed[1] - params: min: 0, max: 1
        3) Button B:   Discrete 2  - NOOP[0], Pressed[1] - params: min: 0, max: 1

    - Can be initialized as

        MultiDiscrete([ 5, 2, 2 ])
