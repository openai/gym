Pure Python PNG Reader/Writer

This Python module implements support for PNG images (see PNG
specification at http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-PNG-20031110/ ). It reads
and writes PNG files with all allowable bit depths
(1/2/4/8/16/24/32/48/64 bits per pixel) and colour combinations:
greyscale (1/2/4/8/16 bit); RGB, RGBA, LA (greyscale with alpha) with
8/16 bits per channel; colour mapped images (1/2/4/8 bit).
Adam7 interlacing is supported for reading and
writing.  A number of optional chunks can be specified (when writing)
and understood (when reading): ``tRNS``, ``bKGD``, ``gAMA``.

For help, type ``import png; help(png)`` in your python interpreter.

A good place to start is the :class:`Reader` and :class:`Writer`
classes.

Requires Python 2.3.  Limited support is available for Python 2.2, but
not everything works.  Best with Python 2.4 and higher.  Installation is
trivial, but see the ``README.txt`` file (with the source distribution)
for details.

This file can also be used as a command-line utility to convert
`Netpbm <http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/>`_ PNM files to PNG, and the
reverse conversion from PNG to PNM. The interface is similar to that
of the ``pnmtopng`` program from Netpbm.  Type ``python png.py --help``
at the shell prompt for usage and a list of options.

A note on spelling and terminology
----------------------------------

Generally British English spelling is used in the documentation.  So
that's "greyscale" and "colour".  This not only matches the author's
native language, it's also used by the PNG specification.

The major colour models supported by PNG (and hence by PyPNG) are:
greyscale, RGB, greyscale--alpha, RGB--alpha.  These are sometimes
referred to using the abbreviations: L, RGB, LA, RGBA.  In this case
each letter abbreviates a single channel: *L* is for Luminance or Luma
or Lightness which is the channel used in greyscale images; *R*, *G*,
*B* stand for Red, Green, Blue, the components of a colour image; *A*
stands for Alpha, the opacity channel (used for transparency effects,
but higher values are more opaque, so it makes sense to call it 
opacity).

A note on formats
-----------------

When getting pixel data out of this module (reading) and presenting
data to this module (writing) there are a number of ways the data could
be represented as a Python value.  Generally this module uses one of
three formats called "flat row flat pixel", "boxed row flat pixel", and
"boxed row boxed pixel".  Basically the concern is whether each pixel
and each row comes in its own little tuple (box), or not.

Consider an image that is 3 pixels wide by 2 pixels high, and each pixel
has RGB components:

Boxed row flat pixel::

  list([R,G,B, R,G,B, R,G,B],
       [R,G,B, R,G,B, R,G,B])

Each row appears as its own list, but the pixels are flattened so
that three values for one pixel simply follow the three values for
the previous pixel.  This is the most common format used, because it
provides a good compromise between space and convenience.  PyPNG regards
itself as at liberty to replace any sequence type with any sufficiently
compatible other sequence type; in practice each row is an array (from
the array module), and the outer list is sometimes an iterator rather
than an explicit list (so that streaming is possible).

Flat row flat pixel::

  [R,G,B, R,G,B, R,G,B,
   R,G,B, R,G,B, R,G,B]

The entire image is one single giant sequence of colour values.
Generally an array will be used (to save space), not a list.

Boxed row boxed pixel::

  list([ (R,G,B), (R,G,B), (R,G,B) ],
       [ (R,G,B), (R,G,B), (R,G,B) ])

Each row appears in its own list, but each pixel also appears in its own
tuple.  A serious memory burn in Python.

In all cases the top row comes first, and for each row the pixels are
ordered from left-to-right.  Within a pixel the values appear in the
order, R-G-B-A (or L-A for greyscale--alpha).

There is a fourth format, mentioned because it is used internally,
is close to what lies inside a PNG file itself, and has some support
from the public API.  This format is called packed.  When packed,
each row is a sequence of bytes (integers from 0 to 255), just as
it is before PNG scanline filtering is applied.  When the bit depth
is 8 this is essentially the same as boxed row flat pixel; when the
bit depth is less than 8, several pixels are packed into each byte;
when the bit depth is 16 (the only value more than 8 that is supported
by the PNG image format) each pixel value is decomposed into 2 bytes
(and `packed` is a misnomer).  This format is used by the
:meth:`Writer.write_packed` method.  It isn't usually a convenient
format, but may be just right if the source data for the PNG image
comes from something that uses a similar format (for example, 1-bit
BMPs, or another PNG file).

          zlib compression level: 0 (none) to 9 (more compressed);

          Number of pixels a unit along the x axis (write a
          `pHYs` chunk).
        y_pixels_per_unit
          Number of pixels a unit along the y axis (write a
          `pHYs` chunk). Along with `x_pixel_unit`, this gives
          the pixel size ratio.
        unit_is_meter
          `True` to indicate that the unit (for the `pHYs`
          chunk) is metre.

        The image size (in pixels) can be specified either by using the
        `width` and `height` arguments, or with the single `size`
        argument.  If `size` is used it should be a pair (*width*,
        *height*).

        `greyscale` and `alpha` are booleans that specify whether
        an image is greyscale (or colour), and whether it has an
        alpha channel (or not).

        `bitdepth` specifies the bit depth of the source pixel values.
        Each source pixel value must be an integer between 0 and
        ``2**bitdepth-1``.  For example, 8-bit images have values
        between 0 and 255.  PNG only stores images with bit depths of
        1,2,4,8, or 16.  When `bitdepth` is not one of these values,
        the next highest valid bit depth is selected, and an ``sBIT``
        (significant bits) chunk is generated that specifies the
        original precision of the source image.  In this case the
        supplied pixel values will be rescaled to fit the range of
        the selected bit depth.

        The details of which bit depth / colour model combinations the
        PNG file format supports directly, are somewhat arcane
        (refer to the PNG specification for full details).  Briefly:
        "small" bit depths (1,2,4) are only allowed with greyscale and
        colour mapped images; colour mapped images cannot have bit depth
        16.

        For colour mapped images (in other words, when the `palette`
        argument is specified) the `bitdepth` argument must match one of
        the valid PNG bit depths: 1, 2, 4, or 8.  (It is valid to have a
        PNG image with a palette and an ``sBIT`` chunk, but the meaning
        is slightly different; it would be awkward to press the
        `bitdepth` argument into service for this.)

        The `palette` option, when specified, causes a colour
        mapped image to be created: the PNG colour type is set to 3;
        `greyscale` must not be set; `alpha` must not be set;
        `transparent` must not be set; the bit depth must be 1,2,4,
        or 8.  When a colour mapped image is created, the pixel values
        are palette indexes and the `bitdepth` argument specifies the
        size of these indexes (not the size of the colour values in
        the palette).

        The palette argument value should be a sequence of 3- or
        4-tuples.  3-tuples specify RGB palette entries; 4-tuples
        specify RGBA palette entries.  If both 4-tuples and 3-tuples
        appear in the sequence then all the 4-tuples must come
        before all the 3-tuples.  A ``PLTE`` chunk is created; if there
        are 4-tuples then a ``tRNS`` chunk is created as well.  The
        ``PLTE`` chunk will contain all the RGB triples in the same
        sequence; the ``tRNS`` chunk will contain the alpha channel for
        all the 4-tuples, in the same sequence.  Palette entries
        are always 8-bit.

        If specified, the `transparent` and `background` parameters must
        be a tuple with three integer values for red, green, blue, or
        a simple integer (or singleton tuple) for a greyscale image.

        If specified, the `gamma` parameter must be a positive number
        (generally, a `float`).  A ``gAMA`` chunk will be created.
        Note that this will not change the values of the pixels as
        they appear in the PNG file, they are assumed to have already
        been converted appropriately for the gamma specified.

        The `compression` argument specifies the compression level to
        be used by the ``zlib`` module.  Values from 1 to 9 specify
        compression, with 9 being "more compressed" (usually smaller
        and slower, but it doesn't always work out that way).  0 means
        no compression.  -1 and ``None`` both mean that the default
        level of compession will be picked by the ``zlib`` module
        (which is generally acceptable).

        If `interlace` is true then an interlaced image is created
        (using PNG's so far only interace method, *Adam7*).  This does
        not affect how the pixels should be presented to the encoder,
        rather it changes how they are arranged into the PNG file.
        On slow connexions interlaced images can be partially decoded
        by the browser to give a rough view of the image that is
        successively refined as more image data appears.

        .. note ::

          Enabling the `interlace` option requires the entire image
          to be processed in working memory.

        `chunk_limit` is used to limit the amount of memory used whilst
        compressing the image.  In order to avoid using large amounts of
        memory, multiple ``IDAT`` chunks may be created.

# Regex for decoding mode string
RegexModeDecode = re.compile("(LA?|RGBA?);?([0-9]*)", flags=re.IGNORECASE)

def from_array(a, mode=None, info={}):
    """Create a PNG :class:`Image` object from a 2- or 3-dimensional
    array.  One application of this function is easy PIL-style saving:
    ``png.from_array(pixels, 'L').save('foo.png')``.

    Unless they are specified using the *info* parameter, the PNG's
    height and width are taken from the array size.  For a 3 dimensional
    array the first axis is the height; the second axis is the width;
    and the third axis is the channel number.  Thus an RGB image that is
    16 pixels high and 8 wide will use an array that is 16x8x3.  For 2
    dimensional arrays the first axis is the height, but the second axis
    is ``width*channels``, so an RGB image that is 16 pixels high and 8
    wide will use a 2-dimensional array that is 16x24 (each row will be
    8*3 = 24 sample values).

    *mode* is a string that specifies the image colour format in a
    PIL-style mode.  It can be:

    ``'L'``
      greyscale (1 channel)
    ``'LA'``
      greyscale with alpha (2 channel)
    ``'RGB'``
      colour image (3 channel)
    ``'RGBA'``
      colour image with alpha (4 channel)

    The mode string can also specify the bit depth (overriding how this
    function normally derives the bit depth, see below).  Appending
    ``';16'`` to the mode will cause the PNG to be 16 bits per channel;
    any decimal from 1 to 16 can be used to specify the bit depth.

    When a 2-dimensional array is used *mode* determines how many
    channels the image has, and so allows the width to be derived from
    the second array dimension.

    The array is expected to be a ``numpy`` array, but it can be any
    suitable Python sequence.  For example, a list of lists can be used:
    ``png.from_array([[0, 255, 0], [255, 0, 255]], 'L')``.  The exact
    rules are: ``len(a)`` gives the first dimension, height;
    ``len(a[0])`` gives the second dimension; ``len(a[0][0])`` gives the
    third dimension, unless an exception is raised in which case a
    2-dimensional array is assumed.  It's slightly more complicated than
    that because an iterator of rows can be used, and it all still
    works.  Using an iterator allows data to be streamed efficiently.

    The bit depth of the PNG is normally taken from the array element's
    datatype (but if *mode* specifies a bitdepth then that is used
    instead).  The array element's datatype is determined in a way which
    is supposed to work both for ``numpy`` arrays and for Python
    ``array.array`` objects.  A 1 byte datatype will give a bit depth of
    8, a 2 byte datatype will give a bit depth of 16.  If the datatype
    does not have an implicit size, for example it is a plain Python
    list of lists, as above, then a default of 8 is used.

    The *info* parameter is a dictionary that can be used to specify
    metadata (in the same style as the arguments to the
    :class:`png.Writer` class).  For this function the keys that are
    useful are:
    
    height
      overrides the height derived from the array dimensions and allows
      *a* to be an iterable.
    width
      overrides the width derived from the array dimensions.
    bitdepth
      overrides the bit depth derived from the element datatype (but
      must match *mode* if that also specifies a bit depth).

    Generally anything specified in the
    *info* dictionary will override any implicit choices that this
    function would otherwise make, but must match any explicit ones.
    For example, if the *info* dictionary has a ``greyscale`` key then
    this must be true when mode is ``'L'`` or ``'LA'`` and false when
    mode is ``'RGB'`` or ``'RGBA'``.

        themselves.  Images with a palette (colour type 3)
        are converted to RGB or RGBA; images with transparency (a
        ``tRNS`` chunk) are converted to LA or RGBA as appropriate.
        When returned in this format the pixel values represent the
        colour value directly without needing to refer to palettes or
        transparency information.

        Like the :meth:`read` method this method returns a 4-tuple:

        (*width*, *height*, *pixels*, *meta*)

        This method normally returns pixel values with the bit depth
        they have in the source image, but when the source PNG has an
        ``sBIT`` chunk it is inspected and can reduce the bit depth of
        the result pixels; pixel values will be reduced according to
        the bit depth specified in the ``sBIT`` chunk (PNG nerds should
        note a single result bit depth is used for all channels; the
        maximum of the ones specified in the ``sBIT`` chunk.  An RGB565
        image will be rescaled to 6-bit RGB666).

        The *meta* dictionary that is returned reflects the `direct`
        format and not the original source image.  For example, an RGB
        source image with a ``tRNS`` chunk to represent a transparent
        colour, will have ``planes=3`` and ``alpha=False`` for the
        source image, but the *meta* dictionary returned by this method
        will have ``planes=4`` and ``alpha=True`` because an alpha
        channel is synthesized and added.

        *pixels* is the pixel data in boxed row flat pixel format (just
        like the :meth:`read` method).
