# Gym Contribution Guidelines

At this time we are currently accepting the current forms of contributions:

- Bug reports (keep in mind that changing environment behavior should be minimized as that requires releasing a new version of the environment and makes results hard to compare across versions)
- Pull requests for bug fixes
- Documentation improvements

Notably, we are not accepting these forms of contributions:

- New environments
- New features

This may change in the future.
If you wish to make a Gym environment, follow the instructions in [Creating Environments](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/docs/creating-environments.md).  When your environment works, you can make a PR to add it to the bottom of the [List of Environments](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/docs/environments.md).


Edit July 27, 2021: Please see https://github.com/openai/gym/issues/2259 for new contributing standards
