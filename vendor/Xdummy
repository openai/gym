$program:

    A hack to run a stock Xorg(1) or XFree86(1) X server with the "dummy"
    (RAM-only framebuffer) video driver such that it AVOIDS the Linux VT
    switching, opening device files in /dev, keyboard and mouse conflicts,
    and other problems associated with the normal use of "dummy".

    In other words, it tries to make Xorg/XFree86 with the "dummy"
    device driver act more like Xvfb(1).

    The primary motivation for the Xdummy script is to provide a virtual X
    server for x11vnc but with more features than Xvfb (or Xvnc); however
    it could be used for other reasons (e.g. better automated testing
    than with Xvfb.)  One nice thing is the dummy server supports RANDR
    dynamic resizing while Xvfb does not.

    So, for example, x11vnc+Xdummy terminal services are a little better
    than x11vnc+Xvfb.

    To achieve this, while running the real Xserver $program intercepts
    system and library calls via the LD_PRELOAD method and modifies
    the behavior to make it work correctly (e.g. avoid the VT stuff.)
    LD_PRELOAD tricks are usually "clever hacks" and so might not work
    in all situations or break when something changes.

    WARNING: Take care in using Xdummy, although it never has it is
    possible that it could damage hardware.  One can use the -prconf
    option to have it print out the xorg.conf config that it would use
    and then inspect it carefully before actually using it.

    This program no longer needs to be run as root as of 12/2009.
    However, if there are problems for certain situations (usually older
    servers) it may perform better if run as root (use the -root option.)
    When running as root remember the previous paragraph and that Xdummy
    comes without any warranty.

    gcc/cc and other build tools are required for this script to be able
    to compile the LD_PRELOAD shared object.  Be sure they are installed
    on the system.  See -install and -uninstall described below.

    Your Linux distribution may not install the dummy driver by default,
    e.g:

        /usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers/dummy_drv.so
    
    some have it in a package named xserver-xorg-video-dummy you that
    need to install.

Usage:

	$program <${program}-args> <Xserver-args>

	(actually, the arguments can be supplied in any order.)

Examples:

	$program -install

	$program :1

	$program -debug :1

	$program -tmpdir ~/mytmp :1 -nolisten tcp

startx example:

	startx -e bash -- $program :2 -depth 16

	(if startx needs to be run as root, you can su(1) to a normal
	user in the bash shell and then launch ~/.xinitrc or ~/.xsession,
	gnome-session, startkde, startxfce4, etc.)

xdm example:

	xdm -config /usr/local/dummy/xdm-config -nodaemon

	where the xdm-config file has line:

	     DisplayManager.servers:         /usr/local/dummy/Xservers

	and /usr/local/dummy/Xservers has lines:

	     :1 local /usr/local/dummy/Xdummy :1 -debug
	     :2 local /usr/local/dummy/Xdummy :2 -debug

        (-debug is optional)

gdm/kdm example:

	TBD.

Config file:

	If the file $program.cfg exists it will be sourced as shell
	commands.  Usually one will set some variables this way.
	To disable sourcing, supply -nocfg or set XDUMMY_NOCFG=1.

Root permission and x11vnc:

	Update: as of 12/2009 this program no longer must be run as root.
	So try it as non-root before running it as root and/or the
	following schemes.

	In some circumstances X server program may need to be run as root.
	If so, one could run x11vnc as root with -unixpw (it switches
	to the user that logs in) and that may be OK, some other ideas:

	- add this to sudo via visudo:

		ALL ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/Xdummy

	- use this little suid wrapper:
/* 
 * xdummy.c
 *
   cc -o ./xdummy xdummy.c
   sudo cp ./xdummy /usr/local/bin/xdummy
   sudo chown root:root /usr/local/bin/xdummy
   sudo chmod u+s /usr/local/bin/xdummy
 *
 */
#include <unistd.h>

int main (int argc, char *argv[]) {
	extern char **environ;
	char str[100];
	sprintf(str, "XDUMMY_UID=%d", (int) getuid());

}


Options:

    ${program}-args:

	-install	Compile the LD_PRELOAD shared object and install it
			next to the $program script file as:

			  $0.so

			When that file exists it is used as the LD_PRELOAD
			shared object without recompiling.  Otherwise,
			each time $program is run the LD_PRELOAD shared
			object is compiled as a file in /tmp (or -tmpdir)

			If you set the environment variable
			INTERPOSE_GETUID=1 when building, then when
			$program is run as an ordinary user, the shared
			object will interpose getuid() calls and pretend
			to be root.  Otherwise it doesn't pretend to
			be root.

			You can also set the CFLAGS environment variable
			to anything else you want on the compile cmdline.

	-uninstall	Remove the file:

			  $0.so

			The LD_PRELOAD shared object will then be compiled
			each time this program is run.

	The X server is not started under -install, -uninstall, or -prconf.


	:N		The DISPLAY (e.g. :15) is often the first
			argument.  It is passed to the real X server and
			also used by the Xdummy script as an identifier.

	-geom geom1[,geom2...]	Take the geometry (e.g. 1024x768) or list
			of geometries and insert them into the Screen
			section of the tweaked X server config file.
			Use this to have a different geometry than the
			one(s) in the system config file.

			The option -geometry can be used instead of -geom;
			x11vnc calls Xdummy and Xvfb this way.

	-nomodelines	When you specify -geom/-geometry, $program will
			create Modelines for each geometry and put them
			in the Monitor section.  If you do not want this
			then supply -nomodelines.

	-depth n	Use pixel color depth n (e.g. 8, 16, or 24). This
			makes sure the X config file has a Screen.Display
			subsection of this depth.  Note this option is
			ALSO passed to the X server.

	-DEPTH n	Same as -depth, except not passed to X server.

	-tmpdir dir	Specify a temporary directory, owned by you and
			only writable by you.  This is used in place of
			/tmp/Xdummy.\$USER/..  to place the $program.so
			shared object, tweaked config files, etc.

	-nonroot	Run in non-root mode (working 12/2009, now default)

	-root		Run as root (may still be needed in some
			environments.)  Same as XDUMMY_RUN_AS_ROOT=1.

	-nosudo		Do not try to use sudo(1) when re-running as root,
			use su(1) instead.

	-xserver path	Specify the path to the Xserver to use.  Default
			is to try "Xorg" first and then "XFree86".  If
			those are not in \$PATH, it tries these locations:
				/usr/bin/Xorg
				/usr/X11R6/bin/Xorg
				/usr/X11R6/bin/XFree86

	-n		Do not run the command to start the X server,
			just show the command that $program would run.
			The LD_PRELOAD shared object will be built,
			if needed.  Also note any XDUMMY* environment
			variables that need to be set.

	-prconf		Print, to stdout, the tweaked Xorg/XFree86
			config file (-config and -xf86config server
			options, respectively.)  The Xserver is not
			started.

	-notweak	Do not tweak (modify) the Xorg/XFree86 config file
			(system or server command line) at all.  The -geom
			and similar config file modifications are ignored.

			It is up to you to make sure it is a working
			config file (e.g. "dummy" driver, etc.)
			Perhaps you want to use a file based on the
			-prconf output.

	-nocfg		Do not try to source $program.cfg even if it
			exists.  Same as setting XDUMMY_NOCFG=1.

	-debug		Extra debugging output.

	-strace		strace(1) the Xserver process (for troubleshooting.)
	-ltrace		ltrace(1) instead of strace (can be slow.)

	-h, -help	Print out this help.


    Xserver-args:

	Most of the Xorg and XFree86 options will work and are simply
	passed along if you supply them.  Important ones that may be
	supplied if missing:

	:N		X Display number for server to use.

	vtNN		Linux virtual terminal (VT) to use (a VT is currently
			still used, just not switched to and from.)

	-config file		Driver "dummy" tweaked config file, a
	-xf86config file	number of settings are tweaked besides Driver.

	If -config/-xf86config is not given, the system one
	(e.g. /etc/X11/xorg.conf) is used.  If the system one cannot be
	found, a built-in one is used.	Any settings in the config file
	that are not consistent with "dummy" mode will be overwritten
	(unless -notweak is specified.)

	Use -config xdummy-builtin to force usage of the builtin config.

	If "file" is only a basename (e.g. "xorg.dummy.conf") with no /'s,
	then no tweaking of it is done: the X server will look for that
	basename via its normal search algorithm.  If the found file does
	not refer to the "dummy" driver, etc, then the X server will fail.

	You can set the env. var. XDUMMY_EXTRA_SERVER_ARGS to hold some
	extra Xserver-args too. (Useful for cfg file.)

Notes:

    The Xorg/XFree86 "dummy" driver is currently undocumented.  It works
    well in this mode, but it is evidently not intended for end-users.
    So it could be removed or broken at any time.

    If the display Xserver-arg (e.g. :1) is not given, or ":" is given
    that indicates $program should try to find a free one (based on
    tcp ports.)

    If the display virtual terminal, VT, (e.g. vt9) is not given that
    indicates $program should try to find a free one (or guess a high one.) 
    
    This program is not completely secure WRT files in /tmp (but it tries
    to a good degree.)  Better is to use the -tmpdir option to supply a
    directory only writable by you.  Even better is to get rid of users
    on the local machine you do not trust :-)

    Set XDUMMY_SET_XV=1 to turn on debugging output for this script.
