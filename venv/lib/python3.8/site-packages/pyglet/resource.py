"""Load application resources from a known path.

Loading resources by specifying relative paths to filenames is often
problematic in Python, as the working directory is not necessarily the same
directory as the application's script files.

This module allows applications to specify a search path for resources.
Relative paths are taken to be relative to the application's ``__main__``
module. ZIP files can appear on the path; they will be searched inside.  The
resource module also behaves as expected when applications are bundled using
Freezers such as PyInstaller, py2exe, py2app, etc..

In addition to providing file references (with the :py:func:`file` function),
the resource module also contains convenience functions for loading images,
textures, fonts, media and documents.

3rd party modules or packages not bound to a specific application should
construct their own :py:class:`Loader` instance and override the path to use the
resources in the module's directory.

Path format
^^^^^^^^^^^

The resource path :py:attr:`path` (see also :py:meth:`Loader.__init__` and
:py:meth:`Loader.path`)
is a list of locations to search for resources.  Locations are searched in the
order given in the path.  If a location is not valid (for example, if the
directory does not exist), it is skipped.

Locations in the path beginning with an "at" symbol (''@'') specify
Python packages.  Other locations specify a ZIP archive or directory on the
filesystem.  Locations that are not absolute are assumed to be relative to the
script home.  Some examples::

    # Search just the `res` directory, assumed to be located alongside the
    # main script file.
    path = ['res']

    # Search the directory containing the module `levels.level1`, followed
    # by the `res/images` directory.
    path = ['@levels.level1', 'res/images']

Paths are always **case-sensitive** and **forward slashes are always used**
as path separators, even in cases when the filesystem or platform does not do this.
This avoids a common programmer error when porting applications between platforms.

The default path is ``['.']``.  If you modify the path, you must call
:py:func:`reindex`.
