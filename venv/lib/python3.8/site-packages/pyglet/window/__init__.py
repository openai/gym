"""Windowing and user-interface events.

This module allows applications to create and display windows with an
OpenGL context.  Windows can be created with a variety of border styles
or set fullscreen.

You can register event handlers for keyboard, mouse and window events.
For games and kiosks you can also restrict the input to your windows,
for example disabling users from switching away from the application
with certain key combinations or capturing and hiding the mouse.

Getting started
---------------

Call the Window constructor to create a new window::

    from pyglet.window import Window
    win = Window(width=640, height=480)

Attach your own event handlers::

    @win.event
    def on_key_press(symbol, modifiers):
        # ... handle this event ...

Place drawing code for the window within the `Window.on_draw` event handler::

    @win.event
    def on_draw():
        # ... drawing code ...

Call `pyglet.app.run` to enter the main event loop (by default, this
returns when all open windows are closed)::

    from pyglet import app
    app.run()

Creating a game window
----------------------

Use :py:meth:`~pyglet.window.Window.set_exclusive_mouse` to hide the mouse
cursor and receive relative mouse movement events.  Specify ``fullscreen=True``
as a keyword argument to the :py:class:`~pyglet.window.Window` constructor to
render to the entire screen rather than opening a window::

    win = Window(fullscreen=True)
    win.set_exclusive_mouse()

Working with multiple screens
-----------------------------

By default, fullscreen windows are opened on the primary display (typically
set by the user in their operating system settings).  You can retrieve a list
of attached screens and select one manually if you prefer.  This is useful for
opening a fullscreen window on each screen::

    display = pyglet.canvas.get_display()
    screens = display.get_screens()
    windows = []
    for screen in screens:
        windows.append(window.Window(fullscreen=True, screen=screen))

Specifying a screen has no effect if the window is not fullscreen.

Specifying the OpenGL context properties
----------------------------------------

Each window has its own context which is created when the window is created.
You can specify the properties of the context before it is created
by creating a "template" configuration::

    from pyglet import gl
    # Create template config
    config = gl.Config()
    config.stencil_size = 8
    config.aux_buffers = 4
    # Create a window using this config
    win = window.Window(config=config)

To determine if a given configuration is supported, query the screen (see
above, "Working with multiple screens")::

    configs = screen.get_matching_configs(config)
    if not configs:
        # ... config is not supported
    else:
        win = window.Window(config=configs[0])

    and appears on an appropriate screen for the user.
