"""Formatted and unformatted document interfaces used by text layout.

Abstract representation
=======================

Styled text in pyglet is represented by one of the :py:class:`~pyglet.text.document.AbstractDocument` classes,
which manage the state representation of text and style independently of how
it is loaded or rendered.

A document consists of the document text (a Unicode string) and a set of
named style ranges.  For example, consider the following (artificial)
example::

    0    5   10   15   20
    The cat sat on the mat.
    +++++++        +++++++    "bold"
                ++++++      "italic"

If this example were to be rendered, "The cat" and "the mat" would be in bold,
and "on the" in italics.  Note that the second "the" is both bold and italic.

The document styles recorded for this example would be ``"bold"`` over ranges
(0-7, 15-22) and ``"italic"`` over range (12-18).  Overlapping styles are
permitted; unlike HTML and other structured markup, the ranges need not be
nested.

The document has no knowledge of the semantics of ``"bold"`` or ``"italic"``,
it stores only the style names.  The pyglet layout classes give meaning to
these style names in the way they are rendered; but you are also free to
invent your own style names (which will be ignored by the layout classes).
This can be useful to tag areas of interest in a document, or maintain
references back to the source material.

As well as text, the document can contain arbitrary elements represented by
:py:class:`~pyglet.text.document.InlineElement`.  An inline element behaves like a single character in the
documented, but can be rendered by the application.

Paragraph breaks
================

Paragraph breaks are marked with a "newline" character (U+0010).  The Unicode
paragraph break (U+2029) can also be used.

Line breaks (U+2028) can be used to force a line break within a paragraph.

See Unicode recommendation UTR #13 for more information:
http://unicode.org/reports/tr13/tr13-5.html.

Document classes
================

Any class implementing :py:class:`~pyglet.text.document.AbstractDocument` provides an interface to a
document model as described above.  In theory a structured document such as
HTML or XML could export this model, though the classes provided by pyglet
implement only unstructured documents.

The :py:class:`~pyglet.text.document.UnformattedDocument` class assumes any styles set are set over the entire
document.  So, regardless of the range specified when setting a ``"bold"``
style attribute, for example, the entire document will receive that style.

The :py:class:`~pyglet.text.document.FormattedDocument` class implements the document model directly, using
the `RunList` class to represent style runs efficiently.

Style attributes
================

The following character style attribute names are recognised by pyglet:

``font_name``
    Font family name, as given to :py:func:`pyglet.font.load`.
``font_size``
    Font size, in points.
``bold``
    Boolean.
``italic``
    Boolean.
``underline``
    4-tuple of ints in range (0, 255) giving RGBA underline color, or None
    (default) for no underline.
``kerning``
    Additional space to insert between glyphs, in points.  Defaults to 0.
``baseline``
    Offset of glyph baseline from line baseline, in points.  Positive values
    give a superscript, negative values give a subscript.  Defaults to 0.
``color``
    4-tuple of ints in range (0, 255) giving RGBA text color
``background_color``
    4-tuple of ints in range (0, 255) giving RGBA text background color; or
    ``None`` for no background fill.

The following paragraph style attribute names are recognised by pyglet.  Note
that paragraph styles are handled no differently from character styles by the
document: it is the application's responsibility to set the style over an
entire paragraph, otherwise results are undefined.

``align``
    ``left`` (default), ``center`` or ``right``.
``indent``
    Additional horizontal space to insert before the first
``leading``
    Additional space to insert between consecutive lines within a paragraph,
    in points.  Defaults to 0.
``line_spacing``
    Distance between consecutive baselines in a paragraph, in points.
    Defaults to ``None``, which automatically calculates the tightest line
    spacing for each line based on the font ascent and descent.
``margin_left``
    Left paragraph margin, in pixels.
``margin_right``
    Right paragraph margin, in pixels.
``margin_top``
    Margin above paragraph, in pixels.
``margin_bottom``
    Margin below paragraph, in pixels.  Adjacent margins do not collapse.
``tab_stops``
    List of horizontal tab stops, in pixels, measured from the left edge of
    the text layout.  Defaults to the empty list.  When the tab stops
    are exhausted, they implicitly continue at 50 pixel intervals.
``wrap``
    Boolean.  If True (the default), text wraps within the width of the layout.

Other attributes can be used to store additional style information within the
document; it will be ignored by the built-in text classes.

All style attributes (including those not present in a document) default to
``None`` (including the so-called "boolean" styles listed above).  The meaning
of a ``None`` style is style- and application-dependent.
