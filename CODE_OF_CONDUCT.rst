===================
Gym Code of Conduct
===================

Gym is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or
religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all Gym spaces (including Gist
comments) both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of
conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the
discretion of the moderators.

We may add additional rules over time, which will be made clearly
available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing
and abiding by these rules.

-------------
Our Standards
-------------
Members of the Gym community are **open**, **inclusive**, and **respectful**.
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* **Being open**. Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it's on issues, PRs, problems, or otherwise
* **Focusing on what is best for the community**. We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them to
  improve the community.
* **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.**  We're receptive to constructive comments and criticism,
  as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts.
* **Showing empathy.** We're attentive in our communications, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.
* **Being respectful.** We're respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, experiences, and efforts.
* **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.** When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
* **Using welcoming and inclusive language.** We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering
  an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Harassment of any participants in any form.
* The use of sexual language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind.
* Insults, put downs, or jokes that are based upon stereotypes, that are exclusionary, or that hold others up for ridicule.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission.
* Incitement of violence or harassment towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
* Sustained disruption of online community discussions, in-person presentations, or other in-person events.
* Creating additional online accounts in order to harass another person or circumvent a ban
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting including people of many different backgrounds.

Members asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Consequences
------------
If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the Gym team may take any action they deem
appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for everyone.
